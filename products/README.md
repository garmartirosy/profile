Avoid pushing files larger then 25 MB.

TO CONTRIBUTE: [Fork and run two repos](/localsite/start/steps) (localsite and profile) in a webroot on your computer.  
Add your first name after the project you are working on below, send a PR and email Loren to pull.

TO DO: The token expires every 72 hours, so switch our ["Update Data" GitHub Action](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/actions) to use an email and password as the secrets which generate the token. (Look at how we use a myconfig file locally to get a new token and create a similar process in the GitHub Action.) Test in a fork and document steps for adding the secrets here. The URL for the API may need to be updated to https://buildingtransparency.org/api/epds

TO DO: product-footprints.py and update\_csv\_and\_yaml.py are very similar. Add "-DELETE" to the name of one (as long as we can use the other file two ways: locally and with the GitHub Action workflow). If retaining update_csv_and_yaml.py, change underscores to dashes.

TO DO: Send the cement product rows to their own files in new state folders in profile/cement/US. Save the cement listings within the same process that saves non-cement for states. (Avoid loading and process the CSV file containing all states.)

TO DO: Use Postman to test pulling CO2 for products. Update csv list output with product emission impacts for all states by updating our [Python Profile pull](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/products/pull/)<!-- product-footprints.py -->. View [Resulting Data](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/products/US).

TO DO: Save emissions info within our indvidual YAML files. Include all the impact (emmissions, etc) in each profile. Login to BuildingTransparency.org to view a [detail sample](https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3/epds/ec3mmgup).  Update our notes with your findings and progress. You can use Postman or another app to explore the BuildingTransparency APIs.

TO DO: Change from using UUIDs in the yaml file names. Instead, let's use product names to create SEO-friendly file paths. Retain the subfolders that are product categories.

TO DO: We can also experimenting with [pulling directly to json](pull/get-json/). (Might not work.)


## Fetch Product Data

1. Fork and clone the [Profile Repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile) for 

2. In our products/pull folder myconfig.py file, you'll add a username and password.

3. Get your login (and token) from the [BuildingTransparency.org](https://BuildingTransparency.org) website

For products/pull/product-footprints.py set your BuildingTransparency email and password in [myconfig.py](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/products/pull/) to call the API.


**Run in your Profile folder**  
We have not yet tested "pip install functools" below yet

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate

For Windows

    python3 -m venv env
    .\env\Scripts\activate

Run the following in the root of the Profile repo. Takes over 30 minutes.

    pip install requests pandas pyyaml
    pip install functools
    python products/pull/product-footprints.py

<!--
June 3, 2024 - We copied [product-footprints.py](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/products/pull/) into [Product Footprints Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TJ1fn0-_8EBryN3ih5hZiKLISomOrWDW?usp=sharing) (We haven't run as CoLab yet.)

## Get API Key for Product Profile YAML

The [Central Concrete EPD data](https://github.com/modelearth/io/blob/master/template/product/product-concrete.yaml) was pulled from the BuildingTransparency.org API using the following steps:  

**STEP 1:** Create an account at [buildingtransparency.org](https://www.buildingtransparency.org/)

**STEP 2:** Use your email and password to get your bearer "key" here in Swagger: [openepd.buildingtransparency.org](https://openepd.buildingtransparency.org) - Click Authorize.

NOTE: Your BuildingTransparency API Key will expire after 3 days. Our python process automatically refreshes the key using your settings added to products/pull/myconfig.py.

**STEP 3:** Open a command terminal, and get the "Bearer" secret key entering YOUR EMAIL as the username and YOUR PASSWORD.

    curl -X POST -d "{\"username\":\"YOUR EMAIL\",\"password\":\"YOUR PASSWORD\"}" "https://etl-api.cqd.io/api/rest-auth/login" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json"


**RETURNS**

~~~
{"key":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","last_login":"2021-08-12T02:49:09.850397Z"}%   
~~~

Which you'll append as:

~~~
-H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
~~~

// https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3/manage-apps/api-doc/guide#/01_Overview/01_Introduction.md

Click "Create API Key"
https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3/manage-apps/keys

**Example:**

~~~
curl -X 'GET' \
 'https://openepd.buildingtransparency.org/api/epds?page_number=1&page_size=100' \
 -H 'accept: application/json' \
 -H 'filter: {"epds.name":"ASTM International"}' \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

**Tip:** Use the [EC3 frontend](https://buildingtransparency.org/ec3/material-search) of the tool and watch the commands it issues in the dev inspector's network tab.

# Get YAML for IO Template

[For IO Template](../) - Use OpenEPD swagger

<!-- https://etl-api.cqd.io/ No longer works -->

BuildingTransparency OpenEPD API
[https://openepd.buildingtransparency.org/#/epds/get_epds_id](openepd.buildingtransparency.org/#/epds/get_epds_id)


Inside Postman, you can load the swagger.yaml file [exported from Swagger](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48525546/how-to-export-swagger-json-or-yaml) which will import the schemas into Postman.
