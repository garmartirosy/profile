# SuiteCRM - Partner Database for Azure

<!-- Under Development - SQL table CREATE script for Azure -->

[SuiteCRM](https://SuiteCRM.com) provides a standardized partner admin [database schema](https://schema--suitecrm-docs.netlify.app/schema) with a [large developer community](https://community.SuiteCRM.com).

[Download version 8.7.1](https://suitecrm.com/wpfd_file/suitecrm-8-7-1/) or a more recent [download](https://suitecrm.com/download/) if a matching .sh file is available.
Unzip the download in your webroot. Rename the folder to **SuiteCRM**.

[Get our .sh fork for Mac and Windows - SuiteCRM 8.7.1](https://github.com/ModelEarth/SuiteCRM_Script/blob/main/SCRM_8.7.1_0.1.4_MacWindowsLinux.sh)  
Created from the .sh script initially developed by Chris for his 10-minute [Linux install](https://github.com/motaviegas/SuiteCRM_Script) .sh file [video and steps](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252).  

Place in your local SuiteCRM folder and rename the file to **start.sh**

## Our quick install script for Mac, Windows and Linux

[Collaborate with Us](/dreamstudio/earth/) using standardized data tables within Microsoft Azure, SQL Express and MariaDB.
Summary of what's included for each OS within the start.sh script

| OS      | PHP            | Apache        | DB Option                     |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Linux   | via apt        | via apt       | MariaDB                       |
| MacOS   | via brew       | via brew      | MariaDB                       |
| Windows | via Chocolatey | via Chocolatey| SQL Express / Azure / MariaDB |

## Localsite 10-Minute Setup

Open a terminal in your SuiteCRM folder and grant the start.sh file (from above) permission within the folder:

	sudo chmod +x ./start.sh

<!--
	Not from video, probably don't need.
	sudo chmod -R 755 .
-->

As you run the start.sh install, also follow the [steps below video](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252).

We're avoiding sudo here for better security, however you'll need to do additional manual steps below.

	./start.sh

Take note of the user and password of the MariaDB database that will be requested.

**MacOS users** - You may need to run these if you have brew errors:

	brew install --cask temurin

	# Not sure if these two cmds needed
	brew untap homebrew/cask-versions
	brew untap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk

	brew uninstall --cask adoptopenjdk13
	brew uninstall python@3.8


For Error: Permission denied @ apply2files - /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins
Deleting the folder was necessary (better than adding user permissions on Docker folder)

	sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/docker
	brew cleanup

Don't install Docker with Homebrew. 
Docker for Mac (Docker Desktop) provides better performance and integration with the operating system. 


If you installed ImageMagick via Homebrew (which is common), you can safely press Enter to accept [autodetect], because the script will usually find it in the standard Homebrew location. Or use `brew --prefix imagemagick` to find it.

**From the steps below the video:**

[View steps](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252).

When the .sh script finishes successfully, run the cmd:<!-- sudo mysql_secure_installation -->

	mariadb-secure-installation

Most likely it needs to be:

	sudo mariadb-secure-installation

First enter your machine password, then blank for the MariaDB database's root password

Without making any additional changes, initial login response says:
You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.

However the steps under the video:

Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] Y
Change the root password? [Y/n] y
put your DB root password and take note of it!!!
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] Y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] Y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y

Get "IP retrieved" displayed near the start of your start.sh terminal.

Mac webroot:
Default Apache port for Homebrew says "It works!"
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## PHP Site Activation

If you ran `./start.sh` without sudo, you'll likely need to do manual activation here.  

Please share the steps you use by posting an issue in our [profile repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/crm), or fork and send a PR.

The first time you may need to run `./start.sh` again, since database did not initially exist.

BUG: When running a second time, the webroot stopped working.

Probable cause(s) - These appear right before "Installing MariaDB":
PHP module not found. PHP may not work correctly with Apache.
✅ PHP handler configuration added.
✅ Directory listing disabled.


brew services start php@8.2

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php@8.2/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/8.2/

php@8.2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have php@8.2 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find php@8.2 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/include"

To start php@8.2 now and restart at login:
  brew services start php@8.2

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin/php-fpm --nodaemonize
🔧 Updating PATH to use PHP 8.2...
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/php@8.2/8.2.28_1... 25 symlinks created.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH instead consider running:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
