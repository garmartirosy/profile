# SuiteCRM - Partner Database for Azure

<!-- Under Development - SQL table CREATE script for Azure -->

[SuiteCRM](https://SuiteCRM.com) provides a standardized partner admin [database schema](https://schema--suitecrm-docs.netlify.app/schema) with a [large developer community](https://community.SuiteCRM.com).

The original .sh [Linux install](https://github.com/motaviegas/SuiteCRM_Script) script was developed by Chris for his 10-minute  .sh file [video and steps](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252). 

Remote Azure database init has not yet been added to suite.sh. [Send a PR](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/crm).

## 10-Minute SuiteCRM Setup

As you run the suite.sh install, you may want to also check the [steps below video](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252).



1.) Open a terminal in the "profile/crm" folder and grant the suite.sh file permission within the folder:

    sudo chmod +x ./suite.sh

<!--
  Not from video, probably don't need.
  sudo chmod -R 755 .
-->

2.) Run suite.sh in your crm folder. 
SuiteCRM 8.8.0 will be pulled from [downloads](https://suitecrm.com/download/)

<!--
Now run ./suite.sh with sudo to avoid "Permission denied".

The http server currently gets deactivated AFTER php portion regardless of sudo on MacOS.  
Please document how to include permissions for PHP.

admi and admi
changed root password from blank (enter) to admin2
-->

    ./suite.sh --version 8.8.0 --subfolder account

Take note of the user and password of the MariaDB database that will be requested.


**Resulting Apache site:** [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

TO DO: Apache port 8080 still points at the default /usr/local/var/www/.  
Document how to point it at [webroot]/profile/crm/account instead.

TO DO: Try opening MariaDB with [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) and adjust permissions.

TO DO: Add/test DOCUMENT_ROOT for Windows.
<!--

## Update Apache Config

Steps to update the port point at profile/crm/account - Lokesh

1. Edit https.config on DocumentRoot with this code :

DocumentRoot "/Users/lokesh/Desktop/Model_Earth/profile/crm/account/public"
<Directory "/Users/lokesh/Desktop/Model_Earth/profile/crm/account/public">
    Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>

2. Updating the httpd-vhosts.conf with only one host

Replacing whole file with this if we have other than this host

<VirtualHost *:8080>
    ServerAdmin admin@example.com
    DocumentRoot "/Users/lokesh/Desktop/Model_Earth/profile/crm/account/public"
    ServerName localhost

    <Directory "/Users/lokesh/Desktop/Model_Earth/profile/crm/account/public">
        Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog /opt/homebrew/var/log/httpd/crm-error_log
    CustomLog /opt/homebrew/var/log/httpd/crm-access_log combined

    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
</VirtualHost>

3. Giving permission for apache to access our folder

	sudo chmod +x /Users/lokesh/Desktop/Model_Earth/profile/crm/account

4. Then restart Apache

	brew services restart httpd


## PHP and link to SuiteCRM site

For a proper SuiteCRM installation, you'll want Apache or Nginx configured with PHP-FPM rather than a PHP server since:

- SuiteCRM expects certain URL rewriting rules and directory access controls
- Better handling of file uploads and larger requests
- Support for .htaccess files that control access to sensitive directories
- More robust handling of concurrent users
- Better security controls

So we're trying to AVOID using this cmd to Launch a PHP server in crm/account/public at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

But it's the only PHP approach we have working so far (but not with MariaDB yet).
You can run the 10-minute setup below first to download and unzip the SuiteCRM files into the account folder.

    php -S localhost:8000 -t ./account/public

Note that the port above is 8000, and not the 8080 used with suite.sh download/installer.

<!--
Plus we'd need to launch on port 8080 to use with Apache init in suite.sh
-->

**Resulting PHP SuiteCRM site:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)


## Apache PHP-FPM Investigations

Attempting to figure out why Apache is not pointing at profile/crm/account running suite.sh script.

<!--
This issue could be limited to Macs that are 2020 and older.
Apple began transitioning its Mac computers from Intel processors to Apple silicon starting in late 2020.
Intel (older computers): /usr/local/...
Apple Silicon: /opt/homebrew/...

Run the following and you'll see "It works!" at http://localhost:8080/

Create the missing file and update the httpd.conf file.
-->

For installations through Homebrew, files are at /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf.
Otherwise the Apache httpd.conf file might are at /etc/apache2/httpd.conf. 
So the following changes ot the Apache default after a Homebrew install.

    sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra
    sudo cp /usr/local/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

Create the missing log directory

    sudo mkdir -p /opt/homebrew/var/log/httpd
    sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff /opt/homebrew/var/log/httpd

    sudo apachectl configtest
    sudo apachectl start


In /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf you could try changing "/usr/local/var/www" to the path to your "[webroot]/profile/crm/account" folder.

If no effect, try the other httpd.conf file here:
/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra

<!--
That had:
/usr/local/var/www/crm/public

Gave it permissions (this was a Hello World test file):
sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/var/www/crm/index.php
sudo chown $(whoami):staff /usr/local/var/www/hello.php

EDIT /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
-->

Both of these need to be in /usr/local/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Listen 8080
ServerName 192.168.1.202:8080

Try in /opt/homebrew too

Also try adding:
LoadModule php_module /usr/local/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

And make sure this is not getting added multiple times by suite.sh

<FilesMatch \.php$>
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

Restart Apache

    sudo brew services restart httpd


## Debugging Errors

Check Apache error logs. (This is very useful): 

    tail -f /usr/local/var/log/httpd/error_log

## Quick install script for Mac, Linux and Windows

[Collaborate with us](/dreamstudio/earth/) using standardized data tables within Microsoft Azure, SQL Express and MariaDB.
Summary of what's included for each OS within the suite.sh script

| OS      | PHP            | Apache        | DB Option                     |
|---------|----------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| <a href="#mac">MacOS</a>   | via brew       | via brew      | MariaDB                       |
| <a href="#linux">Linux</a>   | via apt        | via apt       | MariaDB                       |
| <a href="#windows">Windows</a> | via Chocolatey | via Chocolatey| SQL Express / Azure / MariaDB |

<br>
**MacOS users** - You may need to run these if you have brew errors:

	brew install --cask temurin

	# Not sure if these two cmds needed
	brew untap homebrew/cask-versions
	brew untap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk

	brew uninstall --cask adoptopenjdk13
	brew uninstall python@3.8


For Error: Permission denied @ apply2files - /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins
Deleting the folder was necessary (better than adding user permissions on Docker folder)

	sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/docker
	brew cleanup

Don't install Docker with Homebrew. 
Docker for Mac (Docker Desktop) provides better performance and integration with the operating system. 


If you installed ImageMagick via Homebrew (which is common), you can safely press Enter to accept [autodetect], because the script will usually find it in the standard Homebrew location. Or use `brew --prefix imagemagick` to find it.

**From the steps below the video:**

[View steps](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252).

The following cmd is included in the suite.sh file. 
It only runs if the MariaDB is not yet installed.
The older name for the cmd was: mysql\_secure\_installation

	sudo mariadb-secure-installation

First enter your machine password, then (possibly) blank for the MariaDB database's root password

Initial login response says:
You already have your root account protected, so you can safely answer 'n'.
But we enter all Y's.

The steps under [the 10-minute video](https://community.suitecrm.com/t/how-to-install-suitecrm-8-6-1-under-10-minutes/93252) are:
Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] y
Change the root password? [Y/n] y
put your DB root password and take note of it!!!
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y

**IP retrieved**
Get your "IP retrieved" near the start of your suite.sh terminal.

**Webroot at localhost:8080**
The Apache port at localhost:8080 says "It works!"  
<!-- previously it broke (stopped) when running the PHP install portion. -->
But it doesn't point at the correct path in /profile/crm/account yet.

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## PHP Site Activation
 
Please document steps that work for you by posting an issue in our [profile repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/tree/main/crm), or fork and send a PR.

Older note, not sure this still applies...

The first time you may need to run `./suite.sh` again - if the database did not initially exist.

BUG: When running a second time, the webroot stopped working.

Probable cause(s) - These appear right before "Installing MariaDB":
PHP module not found. PHP may not work correctly with Apache.
✅ PHP handler configuration added.
✅ Directory listing disabled.


## To Try for PHP...

    brew services start php@8.2

<!--
  brew services restart php@8.2
-->

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to httpd.conf and restart Apache:
    LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php@8.2/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>

Finally, check DirectoryIndex includes index.php
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

The php.ini and php-fpm.ini file can be found in:
    /usr/local/etc/php/8.2/

php@8.2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have php@8.2 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find php@8.2 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/include"

To start php@8.2 now and restart at login:

    brew services start php@8.2

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

    /usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin/php-fpm --nodaemonize

🔧 Updating PATH to use PHP 8.2...
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/php@8.2/8.2.28_1... 25 symlinks created.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH instead consider running:

    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@8.2/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
